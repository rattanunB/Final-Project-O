          <h3>ABS</h3>
          <p>
          In the context of health and fitness, "ABS" typically refers to abdominal muscles. These are the muscles located in your abdominal region, commonly known as your "core." They play a significant role in various bodily functions and are important for overall health and well-being.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Remember that while having strong abdominal muscles is important, overall fitness and health also depend on factors like a balanced diet, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and proper rest. A holistic approach to health and fitness is the key to well-being.
