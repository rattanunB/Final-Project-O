## Visuals 💻

<!-- Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method. -->

## Installation 🤖

<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->

To obtain the source codes and the dependent modules, run the git-command in your `projects` folder:

1. Clone Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanMun/final-project-frontend.git
```

2. Clone Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanMun/final-project-backend.git
```

3. Install package and dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Project Run and Test

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap 🛣️

<!-- If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README. -->

| **Scale** | **What to act**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **S**   | Conclusively, our ultimate goal entails the integration of a ranking mechanism on a weekly and monthly basis, achieved by aggregating comprehensive data sourced from the dashboard. This innovation is set to provide an engaging dimension to our platform, fostering a sense of accomplishment and healthy competition among users.                                                             |
|   **M**   | Starting from a family setting, our aspiration is to gradually extend our reach to our professional colleagues and ultimately, the wider public. This strategic progression would enable me to venture into the commercial pattern with my web application and attract sponsorship opportunities.                                                                                                  |
|   **L**   | Subsequently, we intend to amplify its visibility through an incentive system. As a prime illustration, we plan to incorporate a rewards program featuring offerings such as discounted vouchers for sports equipment, coupons for nutrition products, and collaborations with vegan food establishments. This strategic approach is poised to elevate the widespread recognition of our platform. |

## Contributors 🦸

<!-- State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser. -->
